# Using Manifold with Kotlin (and other JVM languages)

Although Manifold is a _Java_ compiler plugin, you can reap many of its benefits from Kotlin and other JVM languages. Some
of Manifold's features are specific to the Java compiler, however, such as Extensions, @Jailbreak, and the preprocessor.
Because these features are exclusive to the Java language, they are not accessible from other languages. Other features,
like GraphQL, JSON, XML, and Templates are not specific to the Java language, therefore they are accessible from any
JVM language.

These features are called _type manifolds_ and they work by automatically transforming resources such as *.graphql*,
*.json*, and *.xml* files directly to Java types without a code generation step or compiling between changes in your
IDE. The only difference with Kotlin is the resource files must be placed in a separate Java module. The indirection
allows Manifold to transform the resources into Java types behind the scenes. Perhaps the most important detail is that
via the Manifold IDE plugin, Kotlin can use Manifold just as effectively as Java. The development experience is
identical. For instance, you can make GraphQL changes and instantly access them in Kotlin code, no compilation in
between. Use IntelliJ or Android Studio to deterministically refactor/rename, find Kotlin usages from GraphQL, code
completion, etc. 
 
## Get the Manifold plugin

The the Manifold plugin directly from within IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio via `Settings | Plugins | Marketplace | search "Manifold"`.
You must restart Android Studio to enable the plugin. 

## The Kotlin sample application

The [Kotlin sample application](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold-sample-kotlin-app) best illustrates how to
setup your environment and build for use with Manifold. Use it as a reference to use Manifold with your own Kotlin app.
